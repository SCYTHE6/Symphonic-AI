Symphonic-AI: Music Generation with LSTM
Symphonic-AI is a deep learning project focused on generating novel musical sequences. It learns the patterns, melodies, and harmonies from a given dataset of musical pieces and uses that knowledge to compose new music. This implementation uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is well-suited for sequence generation tasks.

üé∂ Features

‚Ä¢ MIDI Data Processing: Parses and processes MIDI files to extract musical notes and chords using the Music21 toolkit.

‚Ä¢ Data Serialization: Uses pickle to save processed note sequences, allowing for quick reloading without needing to re-process the entire MIDI dataset.

‚Ä¢ Sequence Modeling: Creates sequences of musical events to be fed into the neural network.

‚Ä¢ LSTM Network: Utilizes a robust LSTM network to learn the temporal dependencies and structure of the music.

‚Ä¢ Efficient Training: Implements ModelCheckpoint to save the best version of the model during training, preventing loss of progress.

‚Ä¢ Music Generation: Generates new musical note sequences based on the patterns learned by the model.

‚Ä¢ Output to MIDI: Converts the generated sequences back into a playable MIDI file.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

‚Ä¢ Python: The core programming language.

‚Ä¢ TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.

‚Ä¢ Music21: A powerful toolkit for computer-aided musicology, used for parsing MIDI files and handling musical objects.

‚Ä¢ NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.

‚Ä¢ Pickle: For serializing and de-serializing Python objects (saving/loading processed data).

‚Ä¢ Glob: For finding files matching a specific pattern (locating all MIDI files).

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1 - Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SCYTHE6/Symphonic-AI.git
cd Symphonic-AI

2 - Install dependencies:
It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Ensure your requirements.txt includes tensorflow, music21, and numpy)

3 - Download the dataset:

The project is designed to work with MIDI datasets. The maestro-v3.0.0.zip file in the repository contains the Maestro dataset.

Extract the MIDI files into a known directory.

üöÄ How to Run

The core logic is contained within the Symphonic-AI.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

1 - Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

2 - Open Symphonic-AI.ipynb.

3 - Modify the path in the notebook to point to your directory of MIDI files.

4 - Run the cells in order to:

‚Ä¢ Parse all MIDI files and extract notes and chords.

‚Ä¢ Save the processed notes to a pickle file.

‚Ä¢ Load the notes and create sequences for training.

‚Ä¢ Build and compile the LSTM model.

‚Ä¢ Train the model on the prepared sequences.

‚Ä¢ Generate new note sequences using the trained model.

‚Ä¢ Save the generated output as a new MIDI file (e.g., test_output.mid).

üß† Model Architecture
The model is built using a Keras Sequential model with multiple LSTM layers, which excel at learning from sequential data.

‚Ä¢ Input Layer: Takes sequences of musical notes/chords.

‚Ä¢ LSTM Layers: Multiple LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies.

‚Ä¢ Dropout Layers: Included to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.

‚Ä¢ Dense Layers: Fully connected layers to process the LSTM output.

‚Ä¢ Batch Normalization: Used to stabilize and accelerate the training process.

‚Ä¢ Activation Layer: A final softmax activation layer to predict the next note in the sequence.

üéº Generated Music
After running the notebook, you will find a test_output.mid file (or a similar name) in your directory. You can play this file using any MIDI player or digital audio workstation (DAW) to listen to the music created by your AI!
